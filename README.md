I decided to automate this search as best I could to see if this actually existd.

##Requires:
npm install python-shell request twitter


No guarantees on this. Know how to setup twitter API keys and then go from there. You need to manually update the parameters when the tweet ID limit is. I also am stripping off replies on this.
